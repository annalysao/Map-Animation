# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description of the project: 
This project displays a map of the area around MIT and Harvard. Upon clicking the button, a marker moves through the various bus stops between MIT and Harvard. I am adjusted the styling from the original code.

## How to Run: 
1. Download the HTML, CSS, and JS files locally.
2. Create a MapBox account.
3. Add your own access token for MapBox into mapanimation.js.
4. Drag and drop index.html into your browser.
5. Click on the 'Show stops between MIT and Harvard' button to start the bus marker movement.

### Roadmap of future improvements: 
-Change the marker icon and create a custom marker for the individual bus stops.
-As the bus marker moves to each bus stop, a new marker will be left at the bus stop location that displays the stops' name, route number, and link to the bus schedule for that stop.
